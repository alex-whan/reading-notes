# Reading 14b: What Google Learned About Teams

### "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team"

#### Google's Original Conclusions

* Google's conclusions after studying 180 teams for over a year:
  - **Group norms** seemed to matter the most to team dynamics/success
  - Group norms are essentially the social rules that govern behavior while coming together in groups
  - However, group norms were *not* the same across all groups

#### Key Takeaways from the Study

* "Teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything."
- These teams were all different, too - in terms of their interactions, workflow, etc.
- The key was: **how teams treated one another**

* Regardless of the team makeup/modus operandi, the "right norms" could help a team excel and increase their collective intelligence
  - The "wrong norms" could hinder a team regardless of intelligence


#### Common Indicators of "Strong" Teams
1. Members spoke roughly the same proportion ("equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking")
  - As long as everyone got chances to speak, the team functioned well
  - Teams that had one person/small group talking all the time were less "collectively intelligent"

2. Teams had high "average social sensitivity"
  - A.K.A., could pick up on how others on the team felt based off of verbal and nonverbal cues
  - Could sense when members were upset or left out

#### Psychological Safety

* Teams created a safe environment for "interpersonal risk-taking" - known as **psychological safety**
