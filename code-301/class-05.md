# Reading 5: Heroku Deployment

### HEROKU

#### What Is Heroku?

**Heroku** is a cloud application platform/hosting service that gives applications a place to "live" on the internet without worrying about technical infrastructure.

* Better than GitHub Pages when it comes to server-side ability, as Heroku handles server demands better than GitHub.

* Heroku is known as a cloud **"platform as a service (PaaS)"**
  - Allows you to build/deploy your own web server

* Heroku creates a random name for your application on startup

* All Heroku apps begin without branches or code
  - You will specify a **remote branch** to deploy to the first time

* You can use **Node.js** with Heroku to build your server-side components of the application
  - Node is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment
  - Allows you to write regular JavaScript on the backend
