# Reading 6: APIs Continued

**API** = **Application Programming Interface**

### REST

**REST** = **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer
  - REST is an architecture used for the purpose of web APIs and data communication

* REST is the architectural style/basis for the entire world wide web:
  - Provides a definition of a **resource** - i.e., what a HTTPs "points" to
  - A web page is an example of a specific **representation** of a resource - most resources only have one representation, although in theory they could have multiple
  - **Resources** themselves are concepts (like URLs)


* REST supports the most common **HTTP methods** for interaction between applications and machines:
  - **GET:** Retrieves a resource (returns records or data you feed in)
  - **PUT:** Changes the state of or updates a resource (object, file)
  - **DELETE:** Creates that resources
  - **POST:** Removes that resource

  * **RESTful APIs** (or REST APIs): Any web service that uses REST architecture

  * **Polymorphism:** A programming/CS theory that different "nouns" (resources) can have the same "verb" (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, etc) applied to them
