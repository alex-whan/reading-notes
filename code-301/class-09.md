# Reading 9: Refactoring & Functional Programming

### Functional Programming Concepts



### Refactoring Javascript for Readability

* **Good code** = Finding the "middle ground" between *speed* and *comprehension* 
  - We want our code to be efficient, but also human-readable and manintainable

  #### Strategies for Refactoring and Reducing Code

  * Return early from functions

  * Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences

  * Check for **Web APIs** before implementing your own functionality

  #### Key Concepts

  * Keep in mind: There will *always* be **edge cases** - sooner or later something will break your code

  * It's often tough to go back and refactor code when working for a company - as once it's functioning, it becomes difficult to convince them changes are needed for the future
    - Better to get things right the first time
