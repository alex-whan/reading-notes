# Reading 15: Diversity and Inclusion

### Silicon Valley's Gender Gap - The Result of Computer-Game Marketing in the 1980s

* In 2014, 70% of the employees in top tech companies in Silicon Valley (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc) were male
  - In technical roles, only around 10% of the workforce was female

* The ratio of men and women in computer science approached parity in the 1970s and 1980s - and 37% of computer science grads in 1984 were women

* By 2016, the number was only 18%
  - Huge dip beginning in the mid-1980s that has continued to today

#### Marketing Games and the Tech Industry

* A large factor may be the use of early computers for gaming
  - Games were marketed specifically to boys at the time
  - This included games on computer, along with other consoles

* A huge video game crash/recession in 1983 cause a massive drop in the market in the US (thanks to a flood of low-quality games that reduced consumer confidence)
  - End result: Industry was essentially rebuilt/marketed towards the small remaining audience (aka - mostly boys)

* "Game Boy", etc - lots of factors contributed to create a chicken-and-egg cycle of targeted marketing
  - Reinforced the idea that gaming was for boys only
  - Huge popularity of the Nintendo Game Boy in "saving" the industry

* This problem contributed to a widening gap in experience between young men and women with games and technology
  - "Snowball" effect of fewer women testing into advanced computer science programs at the university level in the 1990s
  - Narrative around advertising technology needs to change (still aimed primarily at men)

* Male-dominated culture in the technology field makes for an isolating environment for female employees and specialists

### Why Diversity Matters to Your Tech Company

* Diverse teams are smarter and more creative

* Diverse companies perform better

* Companies are losing out on great talent by not diversifying

* Diverse companies can better serve and represent a diverse user base

* Can help to break down existing social inequalities
