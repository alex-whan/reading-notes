# Reading Notes

### About This Site

Hello there! My name is Alex, and I'm a Code Fellows student training to become a software developer. A born-and-raised Washingtonian, I've long been interested in learning to code thanks to the thriving technology industry in my beautiful hometown of Seattle. Pacific Northwest is best, as they say.

I’ve been fascinated by coding for a long time in large part due to my love of languages and linguistics, and I love how technology has the ability to be a universal language no matter where you are in the world. 

This website features reading notes from throughout my Code 201 and Code 301 courses, which will help to document my learning journey in the coming weeks. This site will also eventually feature reading notes from my future Code 401 course. Please find the links to each reading and topic below, organized by course.
