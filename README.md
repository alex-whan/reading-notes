# Code 201 Reading Notes

### About This Site

Hey there! My name is Alex, and I'm a student in Code Fellows' Code 102 course. A born-and-raised Washingtonian, I've long been interested in learning to code thanks to the thriving technology industry in my beautiful hometown of Seattle. Pacific Northwest is best, as they say.

This website features reading notes from throughout my Code 201 course, which will help to document my learning journey in the coming weeks. Please find the links to each reading and topic below.
