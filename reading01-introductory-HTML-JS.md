# Reading 1: Introductory HTML & JavaScript

## Selected notes from readings in *HTML & CSS* by Jon Duckett

### Chapter 1 - Structure

#### Key Concepts of Website Structure
* HTML pages are ultimately text documents displaying content
* HTML documents use **tags** to give certain content special meaning/importance
* Tags: special characters written in angled brackets (nearly always in pairs)
* These specially-designated combinations of tagged text/characters are known as **elements**

### Chapter 8 - Extra Markup

#### Key Extra Markup Cheatsheet
* Comments in HTML: ```<!-- -->```
Comments are very important for leaving notes in code that will not show up in the browser, making it much easier to understand your thinking when revising older code or when someone else is reading your code.
* Doctypes: Tells the browser which version of HTML is being used
* ID attribute: Uniquely identifies that element from all others on the page - though no two elements on the same page can have the same unique ID value
* Class attribute: Identifies several different special elements within a document
* Inline, block, and inline-block elements: Organizes content into different spacing/layout on page

### Chapter 17 - HTML 5 Layout

#### Key Features of HTML 5
* New elements that allow for clearer and more effective division of a page
* Element names are more intuitive and self-explanatory
* More specific and specialized layout elements to help demonstrate and describe a page's structure
* These elements also make it easier for accessibility software to discern the most important information on a page

#### Elements of HTML 5
* Headers: ```<header>```
* Footers: ```<footer>```
* Navigation: ```<nav>```
* Articles: ```<article>```
* Asides: ```<aside>```
* Sections: ```<section>```
* Heading Groups: ```<h1> <h2> <h3>```
* Figures & Captions: ```<figure> <figcaption>```
* Divs: ```<div>```

### Chapter 18 - Process and Design

#### Key Website Design Considerations
* Target audience - who is the website *for*?
* What are the requirements and needs of the target audience?
* How do I present the required information/content in an accessible and appealing format?
* What information will the audience need? How often will they need it?
* Do they need generic information, or do they have specific goals?

#### Planning a Website
* Site Map: a diagram/tree of pages to be used on the site and how they will be grouped
* Wire frame: a basic overview/layout of the most critical information that needs to go on each page - helping to visualize needed space
