# Prework 3: How to Think Like a Programmer - Lessons in Problem Solving

### Why Is Problem Solving Important?

- Problem solving is a system that can help you to break down and digest the problem in more managable pieces

- The best systems include:

  - Having a framework
  - Practicing said framekwork

- Many employers prioritize problem-solving skills above almost everything else
  - Can be considered more important that pure "knowledge" of programming languages or system design
  - Demonstrates computational thinking and the ability to break down complex problems (valuable for any job)

### Have a Framework

#### Key Steps in a Problem-Solving Framework:

- _"The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems"_

1. **Understand**

- Know _what_ is being asked - understanding the problem is the first big step
- If you can't explain the problem in plain English, you don't understand it well enough
- Explaining the problem can help you to identify holes or issues you might not have noticed before
- Solution: **Write it down**, **draw a diagram**, or **try to explain it to someone else**

2. **Plan**

- Don't just dive into something without a plan or roadmap for how to do it - **plan your solution**
- Write down the exact steps needed to give yourself time to process the information
- Solution: **Programmers can use _comments_ to help with this**

3. **Divide**

- Do not try to solve one giant problem - **break the problem into sub-problems**
- Try solving each sub-problem individually, starting with the simplest
- If a sub-problem is causing problems on its own, try to break it down even further
- Once all sub-problems are solved, you can connect them to create a solution to the original problem
- Perhaps the **most important** step of all of these

4. **Stuck?**

- Several steps to follow when stuck:
  - Debug (go step by step through a problem)
  - Reassess (take a step back and try a new perspective)
  - Start fresh (delete everything and start anew)
  - Research (the Google machine!)

### Practice!

- You need to solve a _lot_ of problems to become a good problem solver - have patience, get lots of repetition, and don't expect it all to happen at once
- Practice **micro problem-solving** (i.e. one code challenge each day)

### Conclusion

- Problem-solving is an incredibly important skill to cultivate as a programmer and a professional
