# Reading 3: Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

**1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?**

**2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?**

**3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?**

**4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?**

**5. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.**
