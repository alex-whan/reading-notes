# Reading 1: Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

**1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?**

A situation in which you'd run JavaScript code **outside of a browser** would be in a **Node** environment - that is, **running JavaScript on the back-end**. This allows you to operate a server to serve your front end, access data in databases, write new data to them, and to interact with APIs.

**1. What is the difference between a module and a package?**

A **module** in Node.js is essentially equivalent to a single JavaScript file. A **package**, on the other hand, is a collection of modules/files wrapped together (much like a library) that developers can download and reuse.
