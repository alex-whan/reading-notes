# Prework 2: Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You'll Become 100x More Productive

### "How you value your time is how you value your life"

* Being "busy" isn't a sign of being productive - it can show a lack of focus

* Successful/efficient people don't spend more time being "busy" - but their time that they spend working is very focused on the task at hand

* **Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000**
    - What problems would you stop wasting time on?
    - What things would you stop/start doing?
    - You would likely be far more productive, focused, and effective

* Try to not imagine "business" as a sign of honor - and instead dedicate yourself to being disciplined and using your time effectively
